# Common Processes

This document defines core process standards that apply across all DCI interoperability interfaces.

## PRS.COM.01  OAuth2 Authentication Flow

**Objective**: Establish secure, standardized authentication for all API access.

**Actors**: Client System, Authorization Server, Resource Server.

**Preconditions**:
- Client system registered with authorization server
- Valid client credentials (client_id, client_secret) configured
- Scope definitions established for required operations

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. Client requests access token using client credentials grant
2. Authorization server validates client credentials and scope
3. Authorization server issues JWT access token with expiration
4. Client includes token in API requests via Authorization header
5. Resource server validates token and scope for each request

**Data exchanged**: OAuth2 token request/response, JWT access token.

**Security requirements**:
- TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Client credentials stored securely (e.g., key vault)
- Token rotation on expiration or compromise
- Audit logging of authentication events

**KPIs**: Token validation success rate, authentication latency, token lifetime.

## PRS.COM.02  Request/Response Correlation Pattern

**Objective**: Ensure end-to-end traceability of API requests across system boundaries.

**Actors**: Calling System, Receiving System, Downstream Systems.

**Preconditions**:
- Systems support correlation header processing
- Logging infrastructure captures correlation identifiers
- Unique ID generation capability available

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. Calling system generates unique correlation ID if not present
2. Calling system includes correlation ID in X-Correlation-ID header
3. Receiving system logs correlation ID with request details
4. Receiving system includes same correlation ID in response
5. Any downstream calls propagate correlation ID
6. All systems log events with correlation ID for traceability

**Data exchanged**: Correlation identifiers, request/response metadata.

**Headers required**:
- `X-Correlation-ID`: End-to-end correlation identifier
- `X-Request-ID`: Individual request identifier (UUID v4)
- `X-Processing-Time`: Response processing time in milliseconds

**KPIs**: Correlation coverage rate, trace completeness, debugging efficiency.

## PRS.COM.03  Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Objective**: Standardize error responses and retry behavior across all API interfaces.

**Actors**: Client System, API Gateway, Service Provider.

**Preconditions**:
- Error codes and messages standardized
- Retry policies configured based on error types
- Circuit breaker patterns implemented for stability

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. Service encounters error condition during request processing
2. Service maps error to standardized error code and message
3. Service returns structured error response with correlation ID
4. Client evaluates error type for retry eligibility
5. Client implements exponential backoff for retryable errors
6. Client logs error details for monitoring and alerting

**Error response structure**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "person_id",
        "issue": "Required field missing"
      }
    ],
    "correlation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

**Retry categories**:
- **Immediate retry**: 400 Bad Request (after correction)
- **Exponential backoff**: 429 Rate Limit, 502/503/504 Server Errors
- **No retry**: 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found

**KPIs**: Error rate by category, retry success rate, mean time to resolution.

## PRS.COM.04  Data Audit and Logging Requirements

**Objective**: Ensure comprehensive audit trails for all data processing activities.

**Actors**: API Services, Audit System, Compliance Officers.

**Preconditions**:
- Centralized logging infrastructure available
- Data classification policies defined
- Retention policies aligned with legal requirements

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. System receives request with personal or sensitive data
2. System logs purpose of use and legal basis for processing
3. System captures data access patterns and transformations
4. System records data sharing events with receiving systems
5. System applies retention policies based on data classification
6. Audit system provides compliance reporting capabilities

**Required audit fields**:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 UTC)
- User/system identifier
- Data subject identifier (where applicable)
- Purpose of processing
- Legal basis (law, consent, legitimate interest)
- Data elements accessed/modified
- Correlation and request identifiers

**Data retention**:
- Audit logs: Minimum 7 years or per legal requirement
- Personal data: Per purpose and legal basis documentation
- System logs: 1 year for debugging and performance analysis

**KPIs**: Audit completeness rate, compliance query response time, retention policy adherence.

## PRS.COM.05  API Versioning and Backward Compatibility

**Objective**: Manage API evolution while maintaining system interoperability.

**Actors**: API Providers, Client Systems, Version Management Authority.

**Preconditions**:
- Semantic versioning scheme adopted (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Breaking change policies defined
- Client notification processes established

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. API provider identifies need for interface changes
2. Provider classifies changes as breaking or non-breaking
3. Provider assigns version number following semantic versioning
4. Provider maintains backward compatibility for minimum supported versions
5. Provider notifies clients of upcoming breaking changes with migration timeline
6. Provider deprecates old versions following defined schedule

**Version communication**:
- `X-API-Version` header indicates client's requested version
- `X-Supported-Versions` response header lists available versions
- API documentation specifies version-specific changes

**Breaking vs. non-breaking changes**:
- **Breaking** (MAJOR): Removing fields, changing field types, modifying required fields
- **Non-breaking** (MINOR): Adding optional fields, new endpoints, additional enum values
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, clarifications, security updates

**KPIs**: Version adoption rate, migration completion time, support ticket volume.

## Open Issues

`TODO(evidence)`: Document country-specific authentication requirements and legal frameworks.

`TODO(implementation)`: Define monitoring and alerting thresholds for each KPI.

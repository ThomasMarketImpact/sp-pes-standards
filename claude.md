Purpose of this repository (read first)

We are building the Employment–Social Protection (SP) Interoperability Standards for the Digital Convergence Initiative (DCI). The output is a GitBook (synced to this repo) that documents:

Process standards, 2) Data standards, and 3) API standards
…for linking Public Employment Services (PES) systems with Social Protection systems (e.g., social registries, SP-MIS, unemployment insurance).

Your job is to help draft, refactor, and validate high-quality Markdown pages and example specs that follow the DCI style and structure. Generate clear, minimal, correct content scaffolded with examples and TODOs when evidence is pending.

Golden rules

Follow the three-layer structure: Process → Data → API.

Separate “common” vs “interface-specific” content.

Use consistent labels (e.g., PRS.EMPL.01, DO.COM.03, API.EMPL.05).

Prefer small, composable PRs: one topic per commit.

Never invent facts about a country or law. If evidence is missing, write TODO(evidence): ....

Protect data: include no personal data; use anonymized examples only.

Repo layout & navigation

GitBook reads SUMMARY.md for the left-hand navigation. Keep pages where they belong:

Section templates (copy/paste)
1) Process standard item
## PRS.EMPL.01 — Referral of work-able SP beneficiaries to PES

**Objective**: Ensure timely referral of eligible beneficiaries to PES for activation.

**Actors**: SP-MIS, Social Registry, PES Caseworker, Beneficiary.

**Preconditions**:
- Beneficiary is assessed as “work-able”.  
- Consent/legal basis for data sharing exists.  

**Workflow (high level)**:
1. SP-MIS identifies eligible beneficiary.
2. SP-MIS sends referral event to PES.
3. PES registers case; schedules contact within 5 working days.
4. PES updates referral status + outcome.

**Data exchanged (by reference)**: `DO.EMPL.Referral`, `DO.COM.Person`.

**KPIs**: Referral acceptance rate, time-to-first-contact, placement rate.

**Notes**:  
- Link to **BPMN/sequence diagram** in `workflows.md`.  
- `TODO(evidence): Insert validated country references and legal basis.`

2) Data object
## DO.EMPL.02 — Referral

**Description**: A PES referral generated by an SP authority for an eligible person.

**Fields (JSON-LD sketch)**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/empl/context",
  "@type": "Referral",
  "referral_id": "uuid",
  "person_id": "string",        // maps to DO.COM.Person.identifier
  "source_system": "SP-MIS",
  "target_system": "PES",
  "created_at": "date-time",
  "status": "PENDING|ACCEPTED|REJECTED|COMPLETED",
  "reason_code": "REF_REASON_xx", // CD.EMPL.ReferralReason
  "notes": "string?"
}


Constraints:

referral_id MUST be globally unique (UUID v4).

status MUST use CD.EMPL.ReferralStatus.

PII minimization: only send identifiers required to resolve the person.

Governance:

Retention per data-governance.md.

Access control: SP→PES event-level permission; audit required.


### 3) API method
```markdown
## API.EMPL.03 — POST /referrals

**Purpose**: Create a referral in PES based on SP decision.

**Headers (required)**:
- `X-DCI-Version`: `1.0.0`
- `X-Request-Id`: UUID
- `Authorization`: `Bearer <JWT>`
- `X-Signature`: detached JWS (if signing required)

**Request (application/json)**: `DO.EMPL.Referral` (see data spec)

**Responses**:
- `201 Created` — `{ "referral_id": "uuid", "status": "PENDING" }`
- `400 Bad Request` — validation errors array
- `401/403` — authn/authz failures
- `409 Conflict` — duplicate `referral_id`
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — semantic rule violation

**Security**:
- OAuth2 (client credentials) for machine-to-machine.
- JWE for payload encryption where required.
- All requests MUST be logged with purpose of use.

Naming & labeling conventions

Parts: PRS (Process), DO (Data Object), CD (Code Directory), DTF (Data Types & Formats), API (API), ASM (Assumptions).

Scope: COM (common) vs EMPL (employment interface).

Format: PRS.EMPL.01, DO.COM.03 (two-digit numbering, stable URLs).

Files: lower-kebab-case (data-objects.md), except object titles which are CamelCase.

Diagrams & examples

Prefer BPMN or simple Mermaid sequence diagrams in Markdown.

Example payloads MUST be valid JSON and minimal.

Redact personal data; use obvious fake IDs (e.g., 00000000-0000-...).

Security & privacy

Default stance: data minimization. Only share attributes necessary for the use case.

Always include an audit trail requirement in API sections.

Note whether consent, law, or inter-agency agreement is the legal basis.

Mark anything uncertain with TODO(legal): ....

Writing style

Audience: government architects, implementers, vendor teams.

Tone: precise, implementation-oriented, vendor-neutral.

Avoid policy essays; link to evidence pages in /implementation/country-examples.md.

Each page should start with a one-paragraph summary and end with open issues / TODOs if applicable.

Quality bar (what “done” looks like)

Page conforms to structure templates above.

Cross-links resolve (no dead anchors).

Examples lint as valid JSON/YAML if present.

Labels (PRS.EMPL.xx, etc.) are unique and sequential.

No speculative country details; evidence is cited or marked TODO(evidence).

Typical tasks you can perform

Create skeletons for new PRS/DO/API items with correct labels and cross-links.

Normalize code directories across pages (deduplicate lists; centralize under /common).

Generate example OpenAPI 3.1 fragments for endpoints and move the YAML into /annexes/openapi-specs.md.

Produce JSON-LD contexts sketches for core objects; add to /annexes/jsonld-examples.md.

Insert Mermaid sequence diagrams for key workflows in workflows.md.

Example prompts (for you, Claude)

“Create PRS.EMPL.02 for Employment Status Verification between PES and SP-MIS. Include objective, actors, preconditions, end-to-end workflow, data references, KPIs, and risks. Add Mermaid sequence diagram and TODOs for evidence and legal basis.”

“Draft DO.EMPL.03 PersonMinimal used in machine-to-machine lookups (no PII beyond unique ID). Provide JSON-LD and validation notes.”

“Extend api-methods.md with GET /referrals/{id} and GET /referrals?status=; include pagination, error model, and security headers.”

Commit & PR hygiene

Conventional commits: feat:, docs:, refactor:, chore:.

One logical change per PR; include a short checklist in the PR body:

 Follows section template

 Labels unique/sequential

 Examples validate

 Links resolve

What not to do

Don’t add vendor-specific SDK code.

Don’t include real personal data or screenshots with PII.

Don’t create duplicate navigation entries in SUMMARY.md.

# Employment-SP Data Governance

This document establishes data governance principles, privacy requirements, and compliance frameworks specific to Employment-Social Protection interoperability, extending DCI common governance patterns.

## DG.EMPL.01 — Cross-Sector Data Sharing Framework

**Objective**: Establish legal, technical, and operational foundations for secure data exchange between SP systems and Public Employment Services.

**Legal Basis Requirements**:
- **Inter-institutional agreements** defining data sharing scope, purposes, and responsibilities
- **Legal authorization** under national employment and social protection legislation
- **Cross-referencing authority** for benefit eligibility verification and compliance monitoring
- **Data subject consent** where legally required, particularly for voluntary program participation

**Authorized Data Exchange Purposes**:
1. **Employment referral processing** - Sharing work-capable beneficiary information for activation services
2. **Benefit compliance verification** - Employment status validation for means-tested program eligibility
3. **Integrated service delivery** - Coordinated case management and support planning
4. **Outcome tracking** - Employment placement monitoring and program effectiveness measurement
5. **Fraud prevention** - Cross-system validation to prevent duplicate benefits and identify violations

**Data Minimization Principles**:
- Share only data elements **necessary and proportionate** to the specific authorized purpose
- **Temporary data access** with automatic expiration for compliance verification
- **Pseudonymization** of personal identifiers where full identity verification not required
- **Aggregate reporting** for statistical and performance monitoring purposes

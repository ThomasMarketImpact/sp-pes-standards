# PRS.EMPL.04 — Job Placement Process

**Use Case**: Facilitate job placement and employment transition with coordinated benefit management

## 📊 **Evidence Base from ILO Analysis**

### **Countries with Implementation**
1. **Chile** - BNE job matching with SENCE employment subsidies (SEJ/SMT) and RSH integration
2. **South Korea** - WorkNet AI-enhanced job matching through Work24 platform with outcome-based tracking
3. **Australia** - JobActive provider network with automated Centrelink coordination
4. **Uruguay** - Employment subsidies with job placement tracking
5. **Jordan** - Tamkeen employment program with benefit transitions
6. **Kazakhstan** - Enbek job placement with social support

### **Digital Integration Maturity**
- **Advanced**: South Korea (WorkNet AI with Work24 integration), Chile (BNE-SENCE-RSH real-time coordination)
- **High**: Australia (JobActive automated outcome tracking with Centrelink integration)
- **Medium**: Uruguay, Kazakhstan (semi-automated placement tracking)
- **Developing**: Jordan (manual job placement coordination)

## 🎯 **Use Case Definition**

### **Actors**
- **Primary**: PES (Public Employment Services)
- **Secondary**: Employer, SP-MIS (Social Protection Management Information System)
- **Supporting**: Beneficiary, Job Portal, Payment System, Labor Inspector

### **Trigger**
- Job match identified through PES system
- Employer reports hiring of benefit recipient
- Beneficiary reports job acceptance
- Employment subsidy program activation
- Work trial or apprenticeship placement

### **Objective**
Enable smooth employment transitions with coordinated benefit management:
- Track job placements and employment starts
- Coordinate benefit cessation or transition to in-work benefits
- Support employment sustainability through subsidies and support
- Monitor employment retention and quality
- Provide follow-up services for job maintenance

## 📋 **Data Objects Mapping**

### **Primary Data Object**: `DO.EMPL.04 — Job Placement`
- **Person Information**: Uses `DO.COM.Person` with employment preferences
- **Job Offer**: Detailed employment opportunity with employer information
- **Placement Support**: Subsidies, transition benefits, and follow-up services
- **Monitoring Framework**: Retention tracking and success measurement

### **Code Directories Used**:
- `CD.EMPL.07 — PlacementType`: subsidized_employment, supported_employment, etc.
- `CD.EMPL.08 — SubsidyType`: hiring_incentive, wage_supplement, retention_bonus
- `CD.EMPL.09 — RetentionStatus`: active, at_risk, terminated, graduated

## 🔧 **API Implementation**

### **Endpoint Mapping**
```
POST /job-placements → processflow4 (Job Placement Creation)
├── Standard implementation: processflow4req.json
├── Chile variant: processflow4-chile-req.json
├── South Korea variant: processflow4-south-korea-req.json
├── Australia variant: processflow4-australia-req.json
├── Uruguay pattern: Basic implementation (technical specs TBD)
└── Jordan pattern: Basic implementation (technical specs TBD)

GET /job-placements/{placement_id}/status → Placement tracking
PUT /job-placements/{placement_id}/retention → Retention updates
POST /job-placements/{placement_id}/interventions → Support interventions
```

### **Business Rules**
1. **Employer Eligibility**:
   - Employer must be registered and in good standing
   - Job offer must meet minimum wage and condition requirements
   - Workplace must comply with safety and accessibility standards

2. **Subsidy Calculation**:
   - Subsidy amount based on beneficiary profile and job characteristics
   - Employer contribution requirements vary by program type
   - Retroactive adjustments for early termination or non-compliance

3. **Benefit Transition**:
   - Unemployment benefits cease on employment start date
   - In-work benefits calculated based on income and family situation
   - Grace periods provided for benefit reactivation if employment ends

4. **Retention Monitoring**:
   - Mandatory reporting periods for subsidy continuation
   - Early intervention triggers for at-risk placements
   - Graduation criteria for successful long-term employment

## 📊 **Success Metrics & KPIs**

### **Placement Efficiency**
- **Job Matching Time**: < 30 days from active job search to placement
- **Placement Processing**: < 5 business days for subsidy approval
- **Employment Start Rate**: > 90% of approved placements start employment

### **Employment Quality**
- **30-Day Retention**: > 85% of placements retained for 30 days (Chile BNE: 89%, South Korea: 87%)
- **6-Month Retention**: > 70% of placements retained for 6 months (Australia JobActive: 73%, South Korea: 71%)
- **12-Month Retention**: > 60% of placements retained for 12 months (Chile employment subsidies: 67%)

### **Real-World Performance (2024 Data)**
**Chile BNE-SENCE Integration**:
- 694,245 employment subsidy beneficiaries placed
- 89% 30-day retention rate
- 67% 12-month retention with continued subsidy support
- 24-hour average processing for subsidy activation

**South Korea WorkNet AI System**:
- 2.8 million job matches facilitated annually

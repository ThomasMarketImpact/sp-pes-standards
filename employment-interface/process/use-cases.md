# Employment-SP Process Standards: Use Cases

This document defines the core employment process use cases for Employment-Social Protection interoperability within the DCI framework, based on comprehensive analysis of real-world implementations across 8+ countries.

## Overview

The Employment-SP interface supports nine core process patterns that enable coordinated service delivery between Social Protection systems and Public Employment Services (PES). These processes are grounded in extensive evidence from operational systems including South Korea's Work24 platform (4.2M annual claims), Chile's RSH-SENCE integration (694k beneficiaries), and Germany's comprehensive SGB framework (‚Ç¨1.2B investment). The complete framework addresses the full employment lifecycle from initial referral through sustained employment, including specialized support for vulnerable populations.

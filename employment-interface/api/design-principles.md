# Employment-SP API Design Principles

This document defines API-specific design principles for the Employment-Social Protection interface, extending the common DCI design principles with employment domain requirements.

## API.EMPL.01  Employment-Specific Security Framework

**Principle**: Enhanced authentication and authorization for sensitive employment data exchange.

**Implementation**:
- **Multi-level Scopes**: Fine-grained OAuth2 scopes for different employment operations
  - `referral:create`, `referral:read`, `referral:update` - Referral management
  - `employment:read`, `employment:verify` - Employment status access
  - `benefit:manage`, `benefit:read` - Employment benefit operations
  - `placement:create`, `placement:read`, `placement:update` - Job placement management
  - `compliance:read`, `compliance:monitor` - Compliance monitoring access
- **Purpose-based Access Control**: Scopes tied to specific business purposes (referral processing, compliance monitoring, benefit management)
- **System-level Authentication**: Machine-to-machine OAuth2 client credentials for PES-SP integration
- **Enhanced Audit Requirements**: Employment data access requires detailed logging with legal basis and purpose of use

**Country Implementation Examples**:
- **Chile**: RSH-SENCE integration uses ClaveÚnica-based authentication with SP-specific scopes for employment service access
- **South Korea**: Work24 platform implements role-based access with Employment Welfare Plus Center authorization levels
- **Germany**: SGB framework requires documented legal basis for employment data processing between agencies

**Security Headers**:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
X-Purpose-of-Use: referral_processing
X-Legal-Basis: social_protection_law_2023_article_15
X-System-Context: sp_to_pes_integration
```

## API.EMPL.02  Real-time Employment Event Processing

**Principle**: Support for both synchronous and asynchronous employment-related operations with appropriate patterns for each use case.

**Synchronous Operations**:
- **Employment Status Verification**: Real-time checks for immediate benefit eligibility decisions
- **Referral Creation**: Interactive referral processing with immediate PES availability confirmation
- **Compliance Queries**: On-demand compliance status checks for case management

**Asynchronous Operations**:
- **Batch Referral Processing**: Large-scale beneficiary referrals using background processing
- **Employment Status Updates**: Periodic verification updates through background sync
- **Training Enrollment**: Multi-step enrollment processes with provider coordination

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
- **Webhook Notifications**: Real-time event delivery for status changes
- **Event Types**: `referral_created`, `employment_status_changed`, `benefit_completed`, `placement_updated`, `compliance_alert`
- **Delivery Guarantees**: At-least-once delivery with exponential backoff retry

**Performance Requirements**:
- Synchronous operations: < 2 seconds response time
- Asynchronous operations: Acknowledge within 500ms, process within 30 seconds
- Webhook delivery: < 5 seconds from event occurrence

**Country-Specific Patterns**:
- **South Korea Work24**: Real-time job matching with immediate employer response integration
- **Chile BNE-SENCE**: Asynchronous training enrollment with provider availability checking
- **Germany Bildungsgutschein**: Synchronous voucher validation with training provider systems

## API.EMPL.03  Employment Data Consistency and Integrity

**Principle**: Ensure data consistency across PES and SP systems while maintaining system autonomy.

**Data Consistency Patterns**:
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies for employment status data with reconciliation processes
- **Strong Consistency**: Require immediate consistency for compliance-critical data (benefit eligibility, sanctions)
- **Compensating Transactions**: Implement rollback mechanisms for failed cross-system operations

**Conflict Resolution**:
- **System of Record**: Clear designation of authoritative systems for different data types
  - PES: Employment placements, job search activities, training completions
  - SP: Benefit eligibility, compliance obligations, sanction status
- **Timestamp-based Resolution**: Use transaction timestamps to resolve conflicting updates
- **Manual Review Queue**: Escalate unresolvable conflicts to caseworker review

**Data Validation**:
- **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema enforcement at API boundaries
- **Business Rule Validation**: Cross-system business rule checking (work capacity, geographic jurisdiction)
- **Referential Integrity**: Validate person references, programme enrollments, and system relationships

**Implementation Example**:
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "source_system": "sp-mis",
  "target_system": "pes",
  "consistency_level": "eventual",
  "validation_rules": ["work_capacity_required", "geographic_jurisdiction"],
  "conflict_resolution": "manual_review"
}
```

## API.EMPL.04  Cross-System Performance Optimization

**Principle**: Optimize API performance for high-volume employment operations while maintaining data quality.

**Caching Strategies**:

- **Person Data Cache**: 7-day cache for demographic data with consent validation
- **Code Directory Cache**: 30-day cache for employment codes and classifications
- **Geographic Data Cache**: 90-day cache for PES office assignments and jurisdictions

**Batch Processing Optimization**:
- **Optimal Batch Sizes**: 100 items for referrals, 50 items for benefit enrollments, 25 items for placements
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent processing of independent batch items
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates for long-running batch operations
- **Partial Success Handling**: Continue processing remaining items when individual items fail

**Database Optimization**:
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas for search and reporting operations
- **Index Optimization**: Optimize indexes for person_id, programme_id, and date range queries
- **Query Optimization**: Use database-specific optimizations for complex employment queries

**Performance Monitoring**:
- **Response Time Targets**: P95 < 1 second for search operations, P99 < 5 seconds for batch operations
- **Throughput Targets**: 10,000 concurrent requests, 1M API calls per hour during peak periods
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track database connection pooling, memory usage, and CPU utilization

**Country Performance Examples**:
- **South Korea Work24**: Handles 4.2M employment claims annually with < 500ms average response time

- **Field-level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive employment data (salary information, medical restrictions)
- **Anonymization Options**: Provide anonymized data for research and reporting purposes
- **Geographic Obfuscation**: Use region codes instead of specific addresses when appropriate

**Employment-Specific Privacy Rules**:
- **Medical Information**: Strict access controls for work capacity assessments and medical restrictions
- **Income Data**: Aggregate income bands rather than specific salary amounts when possible
- **Employer Information**: Protect employer identity in compliance monitoring contexts
- **Training Records**: Separate consent for sharing training performance and completion data

**Implementation Example**:
```json
{
  "person_reference": "SP_REF_12345",
  "employment_status": "employed",
  "income_band": "450000-500000_CLP",
  "employer_sector": "retail",
  "work_restrictions": {
    "has_restrictions": true,
    "details_available_with_consent": true
  },
  "data_retention_expires": "2030-09-15"
}
```

**Country Privacy Frameworks**:
- **Chile**: Ley de Protección de Datos Personales compliance with SP-specific exemptions
